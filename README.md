Due to how prominent they are in our daily lives, we decided to delve into the specifics behind popular films and TV shows off of Netflix, one of the most popular streaming services globally. The goals are to identify the patterns within the industry, specifically with what is popular, what is getting the highest ratings, the genres, and many more aspects. The hope is to find some trends and visualize them to easily draw conclusions from them, as well as to better understand the information from the dataset.
